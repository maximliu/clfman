Fault management (FM) play a vital role in the daily operation of teleco providers, however, we identify in
this paper that, Network Function Virtalization (NFV), despite its glorious technical advantages, aggravates
FM in multiple ways: \textit{first}, each abstraction layer has its own approaches to treat faults,
coordination between them is still a missing piece; \textit{secondly}, an effective FM system at each single
layer does not necessarily lead to an overall efficient FM system. A cross-layer FM system is therefore
needed. In this paper, we analyze in details the scenario, problems and challenges faced by constructing such
a system.
