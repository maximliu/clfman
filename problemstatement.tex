The central challenge in the cross-layer fault management lays in the coordination
of various FM appraoches from different layers involved in the NFV architecture
and, frequently, also within individual layers. We classify those problem in
\emph{vertical} and \emph{horizontal} dimensions. In this section, we analyze
research challenges in details accrodingly to the above mentioned dimensions,
then we provide a scenario that clarify an uncoordinated FM will aggreviate the
holistic system when failures impact. 

\subsection{Problems of Vertical Integration of FM Approaches} 

Typically each layer of NFV architecture possesses its own specific FM
approaches to ensure the services offered on this particular layer as we
illustrate in the Table~\ref{tbl:layers}. There is hardly any information
exchanged between layers regarding FM and let alone the coordination of
separated layers, let alone the coordinations among them. We argue that such a
separate approach does not meet requirements of a high efficient overall FM
system. Failing to do so will introduce various sorts of inconsistent problems
in terms of false positives in failure detections, inconsistent fault recovery
actions, which will only aggravate the holistic fault management process in general.

\subsubsection{Virtualization and Physical Layers}

Virtualization technology enable the physical resources to be shared among
multiple virtual instances in terms of computing, networking and storage capabilities. 
While there are different specific forms of resource virtualization, e.g.
server, network, application etc., there are all
