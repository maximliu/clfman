The central challenge in the cross-layer fault management lays in the coordination
of various FM appraoches from different layers involved in the NFV architecture
and, frequently, also within individual layers. We classify those problem in
\emph{vertical} and \emph{horizontal} dimensions. In this section, we analyze
research challenges in details accrodingly to the above mentioned dimensions,
then we provide a scenario that clarify an uncoordinated FM will aggreviate the
holistic system when failures impact. 

\subsection{Problems of Vertical Integration of FM Approaches} 

Typically each layer of NFV architecture possesses its own specific FM
approaches to ensure the services offered on this particular layer as we
illustrate in the Table~\ref{tbl:layers}. There is hardly any information
exchanged between layers regarding FM and let alone the coordination of
separated layers, let alone the coordinations among them. We argue that such a
separate approach does not meet requirements of a high efficient overall FM
system. Failing to do so will introduce various sorts of inconsistent problems
in terms of false positives in failure detections, inconsistent fault recovery
actions, which will only aggravate the holistic fault management process in general.

\subsubsection{Virtualization and Physical Layers}

Virtualization enables physical resources to be shared among multiple virtual
instances in terms of computing, networking and storage. While there are
different forms of resource virtualization, e.g. server, network, application
etc., different approaches have been applied to manage the virtual instances
which mostly concentrate on the efficient control of physical resources.
Features such as tracking of dependencies between virtual resources and their
physical mappings from service point of view is still missing piece.  Such kind
of dependency tracking is essential for the reliability both from top-down and
bottom-up perspective. When fault impacts virtualized resources, FM should
tracking down the associtated physical resources so that new resources could be
employed to mitgate faults and vice versa. This requires precise mappings
between layers since there could be one-to-many (aggregation) or many-to-one
(sharing) relationships between virtualized and physical resources as shown in
Fig.\ref{fig:mapping}.

On the physical layer, FM approaches such as heartbeats and fencing are usually
applied to ensure the high availability of clusters and on the virtualization
layer, monitoring mechanism frequently focuses on the health of virtual
resources, there is hardly any communication between separate approaches.
Configuration as such can seriously introduce inconsistency not only during the
FM operation, but also during daily operations, since each layer makes decisions
based on its own observations of current states.  

\subsubsection{NFVI and NFV Layers}

Same consistency problem could impact the NFVI and NFV layers, where NFVIs are
virtualized teleco services elements and
